# Please don't skip this lecture!
## Secci√≥n 2, clase 16

Of course, you'll receive the code of this course. You can find it attached to **some lectures throughout the course** modules (whenever we finish some meaningful block essentially) and **ALWAYS** attached to the **last lecture of each module.**

The attached code, however, is **NOT a finished project** you could just run. The reason for this is that uploads would explode in size since I'd need to attach the iOS and Android projects, too.

But I provide everything you need: The entire source code we write. You can always **create a new (ejected) project** and **copy my code** into it.

Or simply use my code files to **compare them to yours** - the filenames will be exactly the same as shown in the videos.
