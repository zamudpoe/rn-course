# Preparing XCode (for iOS)
## Secci√≥n 2, clase 19

In the next lecture, we'll run our app on an iOS simulator.

For that, you'll need XCode - the iOS development IDE provided by Apple. Simply search and download it in the App Store of your Mac. Unfortunately, it's not available for Windows.

Once you downloaded and installed it, open it. There, you should add your apple developer account as described here: [Adding Your Account To XCode]

If you don't have a developer account yet, you can create one here: [Cuenta desarrollador] (you don't need to pay for developing iOS apps, a paid account is only required if you then want to publish your app).

Once you added your account, you should set up a team - this is required for signing your apps for development. That's an extra step iOS requires in order to run apps on a simulator or real device. Unsigned (and therefore untrusted) apps are not allowed. You add a team as described here: [Creating Your Team Provisioning Profile]

And that should be all! With that, you should be able to follow along without issues in the next lecture!


**RESUMEN** : Necesitaras pagar a traves de una Tarjeta de Credito para activar tu cuenta de desarrollador si quieres publicar en la App Store
